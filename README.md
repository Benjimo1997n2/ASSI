With @datalogism we worked during two days from the 28<sup>th</sup> to the 29<sup>th</sup> October for the ISSA Hackaton,
out wunderfull team was called ISSA.

We develop a two point of view use cases, where our produced code could be integrated :
- a first one focused on the document
- the second one focused on the descriptors pov
